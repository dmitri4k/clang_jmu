</blockquote><p>This book assumes some prior experience with the C programming language. However, the way that C is
taught as a programming language and how it is used in the systems world are not always the same. As
a simple example, consider the following trivial example of C code:</p>
<div class="highlight-c border border-dark rounded-lg bg-light px-2 mb-3 notranslate"><div class="highlight bg-light"><pre class="mb-0"><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">maximum_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">65536</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In many examples of systems code, this type declaration is too vague to be safe. Specifically,
according to the C language specification, <strong>there is no fixed size for the</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> <strong>type</strong>. While an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> can often be assumed (on modern laptops, desktops, or server machines) to be four bytes in
size, it doesn’t have to be. On some embedded systems, for instance, an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> is only two bytes in
size. This declaration would then be a problem, because the value <strong>65,536 cannot be represented as
a two-byte signed integer</strong> (which range from -32,768 to 32,767). Consequently, systems programmers
typically use more explicit types that clearly indicate the exact size, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uint32_t</span></code>
(unsigned 32-bit integer).</p>
<p>This Appendix is intended as a re-introduction to the C language as used by this text. It is not
intended as a complete introduction for readers who have never used C before. For instance, there is
no coverage here of standard control structures, such as loops or conditional statements. We also do
not cover file-related functions (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fopen()</span></code>) that use pointers to FILE instances, as these
functions are oriented toward ASCII-formatted text files; systems programming typically involves
working with binary-formatted data instead. Instead, this Appendix focuses on intermediate or
advanced features of C that are commonly used in systems programming. We start this Appendix with a
discussion of how to consult documentation and debugging, as these are critical skills for systems
programming.</p>
